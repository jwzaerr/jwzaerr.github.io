					<h3>Instructions</h3>
						<p> After our wedding Marie and I went on a camping/cabin trip to Grand Marais, MN to celebrate and relax.  Leading up to the adventure all I heard about was The Angry Trout.  The first two nights were cold and wet as we camped 30 feet from Superior’s shore.  We checked into a small cabin, showered, and made our way down to Angry Trout.  Our first two night’s in Grand Marais we camped.  The first night we sat by the fire as it rained, retiring to the tent when the temps dipped below 40 degrees, our thighs getting cold from our wet jeans no longer staying warmed by the fire.</p>
