              <h2>The Angry Trout's Maple Mustard Vinagrette</h2>
              <h4>After our wedding we planned a camping and cabin trip to
                Grand Marais to celebrate and relax.  The first two nights
                were cold and wet as we camped 30 feet from Superior's shore.
                We checked into our cabin on the third night.  Looking for a
                good warm meal we made our way down to The Angry Trout.  We're
                not sure why we ate anywhere else afterward!  Whenever we want
                to escape to the North Shore we start streaming WTIP 90.7 and
                reach for this dressing we keep ready to go in a ball jar in
                the refridgerator.</h4>

              <h3>Ingredients</h3>
              <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                <li>¾ cup unrefined sunflower oil</li>
                <li>¼ cup dijon mustard (look for one with tumeric and no
                  sugar)</li>
                <li>¼ cup real maple syrup</li>
                <li>¼ red wine vinegar</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Method</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>We like to whisk up the red wine vinegar, maple syrup and
                  the dijon together in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Add this mixture to the food processor and then add the oil
                  ¼ cup at a time.  Giving the mixture a good blend between
                  each ¼ cup of sunflower oil.  If your food processor has the
                  ability to mix while you pour the oil in slowly, do that.
                </li>
              </ol>
