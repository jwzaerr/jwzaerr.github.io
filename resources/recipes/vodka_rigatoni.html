                <li>5 garlic cloves; firmly smashed and chopped</li>
                <li>4 oz parm</li>
                <li>2 T evoo</li>
                <li>9 oz tomato paste - if using double concentrate tomato
                  paste, use only 4.5 oz</li>
                <li>½ t crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>2 oz vodka</li>
                <li>⅔ heavy cream</li>

              </ul>


              <!-- METHOD -->

              <h3>Method</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Heat water over high heat on one of your front
                  burners - when it starts to form bubbles, add salt with your
                  hand, this helps not to over salt, but you want a salty sea
                  of water for your pasta.</li>
                <li>Chop the onion and garlic; smash first then chop</li>
                <li>Grate 4 oz of parm</li>
                <li>Heat dutch oven on high heat on your other front burner,
                  add 2 T evoo and cook onion, garlic until it starts to brown,
                  lower heat to medium and cook about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add tomato paste and crushed red pepper flakes.
                  Continuously stirring to coat onions and garlic.  Color will
                  transform to a deep but bright reddish brown over 5-7 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add vodka! Deglaze here for a few minutes,
                  stirring to scrape up bits on the bottom. Reduce heat to low.
                </li>
                <li>Temper the cream! Then add to sauce.  Using a heat proof
                  measuring cup, grab ¼ cup of the hot water from the "about
                  to be pasta" water.  Mix this with the ⅔ cup cream. Then
                  slowly add tempered cream to the tomato paste mixture,
                  stirring and slowing adding more until a smooth sauce starts
                  to form. Give it a few more stirs and then remove from heat.
                </li>
                <li>Once water is boiling, add rigatoni and cook until just al
                  dente about 10-12 minutes - refer to cooking instructions
                  with your pasta as this can vary.  </li>
                <li>Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer pasta to the
                  sauce.  All those water droplets are necessary here, full of
                  starch and welcome to the party. Reserve 1 cup pasta water.
                </li>
                <li>Stir sauce to evenly coat all the pasta, then add ½ cup
                  pasta liquid, stirring to create silky, glossy consistency.
                  Typically, ½ cup pasta water is perfect, but add more pasta
                  water if you want/need to thin the sauce. You are going for
                  a smooth - silk degrees - lowdown - barry white - d'angelo -
                  solange mixtape here.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately! Finish with basil and more parm.</li>
              </ol>
