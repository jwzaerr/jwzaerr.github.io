              <h2>Galette Dough</h2>
              <h4>Not just a galette dough.  We've used this dough for tarts &
                pies as well, both sweet and savory.  Add a tablespoon of sugar
                for sweet doughs.  Adapted from

              <!-- INGREDIENTS -->

              <h3>Ingredients</h3>
              <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                <li>175g APF (1½ cups)</li>
                <li>¼ t salt</li>
                <li>4 oz butter (one stick), cut into small cubes.  Keep it really cold.</li>
                <li>¼ cup sour cream (crème fraîche or yogurt works here too)</li>
                <li>¼ cup ice water</li>
                <li>~2 T lemon juice</li>
                <li>Optional egg yolk for brushing onto the dough</li>
              </ul>

              <!-- METHOD -->

              <h3>Method</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>In a small mixing bowl, mix the sour cream, water &
                  lemon juice together & place the bowl in the kool-a-rator
                  for now.
                </li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, add flour, salt & cubed butter.
                  Leaf the butter in your hands until you get get a
                  shaggy/mealy mix.</li>
                <li>Add the wet mix from the kool-a-rator into the dough.
                  Using a spatula scrap the bowl & turn the dough in on itself
                  until the flour absorbs the liquid.  It's going to be sticky.
                  Dont over mix you want a shaggy dough.</li>
                <li>Turn this out onto a lightly floured surface.  Dust the
                  top of the dough with flour as well.  Working quickly to keep
                  the butter cold, make a cohesive mass & roll the dough out
                  long in one direction.  Fold it back onto itself in thirds
                  like you would a letter into an envelope.  Repeat two more
                  times.  We're creating those flakey layers here.  More layers
                  more flakes, but you cant let the butter get warm, or the
                  whole plan goes to hell.</li>
                <li>Form the dough into a small disk a couple inches think.
                  Wrap in wax paper or plastic & stick in the fridge for 20
                  minutes.  Wrap in plastic if you're using the next night.</li>
                <li>Remove dough from kool-a-rator & roll out into a ~14"
                  disk for a galette.</li>
                <li>Place filling of choice into middle of galette dough.
                  Fold the sides onto the filling leaving a small hole (~2"-3")
                  in the middle for steam to escape.</li>
                <li>Brush an egg yolk mixed with a splash of water onto the top
                  to help browning (optional).</li>
                <li>Bake for at least 30 mintues at 425° or until golden brown.</li>
              </ol>
